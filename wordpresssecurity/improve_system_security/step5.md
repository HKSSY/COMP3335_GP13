Wordfence is an endpoint firewall and malware scanner that was designed for protecting WordPress. Wordfence applies the newest firewall rules, malware signatures and malicious IP addresses need to keep your website safe. We are going to install and configure this plugin for practising how to improve the security level in WordPress.

## Install Wordfence on WordPress

To enable 2FA service, you need to install and activate the "Two factor Authentication" plugin on the WordPress plugin search page.

## Setup the 2FA plugin

Upon activation, you need to visit the "Two Factor Auth" page and scroll down to the "Current one-time password" section. The plugin will now show you a QR code which you need to scan using an authenticator app, which can generate a temporary one-time password for the accounts that you save in it.

## Import the QR code to Authenticator App

In this scenario, we will be using Google Authenticator. You can follow this tutorial by using a different app if you want, it is because they all work the same way.

First, click on the "Scan a QR code" button in your authenticator app:

The app may ask permission to access the camera on your phone. You need to allow this permission for scanning the QR code shown on the pluginâ€™s "Current one-time password" section.

Once you are finished, the app starts showing a one-time password that you can use to log in.
