When your website gets hacked or your server crashes, you may lose all data, if you did not have any backup. So, your WordPress website data is important.

Although other security measures are essential, backups are the ultimate insurance. If the worst were to happen, your website with all related files and databases will stay safe and can be restored in a short time. You can create your own manual backups, but you may forget to backup your data, so, installing a plugin that can help you schedule automatic backups can save your time.
