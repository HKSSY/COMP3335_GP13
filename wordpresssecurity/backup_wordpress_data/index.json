  "description": "Welcome! The purpose of the backup is to create a copy of data that can be recovered in the event of your website data failure. Data failures can be the result of hardware or software failure, data corruption, or a human-caused event, such as a malicious attack, or accidental deletion of data. Backup copies allow data to be restored from an earlier point in time to help your website recover from an unplanned event.",
