Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is a method of securing your account. The benefit of this approach is to ensure that you're the only person who can access your account, even if someone knows your password.

## Install Authentication Service on WordPress

To enable 2FA service, you need to install and activate the "Two-factor Authentication" plugin on the WordPress plugin search page.
