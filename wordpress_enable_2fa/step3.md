We will be going to install a WordPress plugin which is called "WooCommerce". That is is a customizable, open-source eCommerce platform built on WordPress.

## Download and Install WooCommerce Plugin

The easiest way for installing a free WordPress plugin is using the WordPress Plugin Directory. It starts by clicking on “Plugins” and "Add New" in the sidebar menu:

Find the plugin by typing the plugin name you are looking for. In this scenario, please type in "WooCommerce" on the search bar. After that, you will see a screen like the one in the screenshot above:
